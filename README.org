=tac-tab-bar= (read: "Tactics for Tab Bar Mode") is an Emacs package that implements an opinionated approach for naming tabs in =tab-bar-mode=

* Principal of Operation

=tac-tab-bar= is based on the principal that the window in the upper-left hand corner of a tab is considered to be the tab's "Main Window". The name of the tab is a function of the upper-left window only. The logic for generating tab names is as follows:

#+begin_example
- IF [the upper-left window is editing a file F] AND [F is in a projectile project P]
- THEN
  - [use the `projectile-project-name` of P.]
- ELSE
  - [Use the major mode of the upper-left window]
#+end_example

In practical terms, this means that each =tab-bar-mode= tab is associated with the projectile project of the upper-left window. If this is not possible because the upper left window doesn't have a projectile project, fall back on the major mode of the upper left window.

* Suggested configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tac-tab-bar)

  (use-package tab-bar
    :after tac-tab-bar
    :custom
    (tab-bar-new-tab-to 'rightmost)
    (tab-bar-tab-name-function #'tactabbar-tab-name-consistent)
    (tab-bar-new-tab-choice #'tactabbar-dired-new-tab)
    ;; Show tab numbers
    (tab-bar-tab-hints t)
    :config
    (tab-bar-mode 1))
#+end_src
